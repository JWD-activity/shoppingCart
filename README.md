## Description
### The challenge
- Implementing a shopping cart by using function components of React.
- The purpose of this app is to display a list of products, and when the user selects the product to order, the app displays the product price, delivery price (free shipping if it is $2,000 or more), taxes, and total price.
## My process
### Built with
- HTML
- CSS
- React-Bootstrap
- Sass
- JavaScript
- React
- NPM
  - **node-sass** https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass 
  - **gh-pages**  https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages

### Useful resources

### Things I applied
- JavaScript Array Methods: filter, find, map, reduce
- React  
  - Function components
  - Props and Events: Passing data between components
  - Conditional Rendering of Components
  - Hooks: useState

### What I learned
- I learned the difference between props and state. Props are read-only, cannot be modified and are delivered from parents. Whereas state can be modified using setState. State change can be asynchronous and created within a component.
